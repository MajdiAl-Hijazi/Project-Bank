## ⚖️ Comparison Between My Implementation and the Original Version

Although both versions implement a Bank Management System using C++, my version introduces several improvements and enhancements in structure, logic, and features.

### 🔹 1. Transaction System Design

**Original Version (Dr. Abuhaddoud):**
- Implements deposit and withdraw operations directly.
- Uses a single function (`DepositBalanceToClientByAccountNumber`) for both deposit and withdraw.
- Transaction logic is partially duplicated across functions.

**My Version:**
- Introduces a dedicated `Transaction Menu`.
- Uses enums to clearly distinguish transaction types:
  - `eDepositTransaction`
  - `eWithDrawTransaction`
- Implements a unified function `ProcessTransaction()` to handle both deposit and withdraw operations.
- Separates logic into smaller reusable functions such as:
  - `PerformTransactionInBalanceClient()`

✅ Result: Cleaner, more modular, and scalable transaction system.

---

### 🔹 2. Code Organization and Modularity

**Original Version:**
- Many functions handle multiple responsibilities.
- Some logic is repeated in deposit and withdraw processes.
- Less abstraction in transaction handling.

**My Version:**
- Better separation of concerns.
- Reusable functions for common tasks.
- Improved readability using meaningful enums and function names.

✅ Result: More maintainable and professional code structure.

---

### 🔹 3. Total Balance Feature

**Original Version:**
- Displays total balances using `ShowTotalBalances()`.

**My Version:**
- Implements a dedicated `TotalBalanceScreen()` with clearer output formatting.
- Calculates and displays the total balance in a more organized way.

✅ Result: Improved clarity and user experience.

---

### 🔹 4. User Interaction and Validation

**Original Version:**
- Validates withdrawal amount against account balance.
- Confirms transactions before execution.

**My Version:**
- Adds more explicit transaction flow.
- Provides clearer messages and better user guidance.
- Improves validation logic inside a unified transaction process.

✅ Result: More realistic banking behavior.

### 🔹 5. Overall Enhancement

| Feature | Original Version | My Version |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| Transaction Menu | ✅ Basic | ✅ Advanced |
| Deposit & Withdraw Logic | ⚠️ Repeated | ✅ Unified & Optimized |
| Total Balance | ✅ Basic | ✅ Improved |
| Code Modularity | ⚠️ Medium | ✅ High |
| Scalability | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Better |
| Professional Structure | ⚠️ Good | ✅ Strong |

### ✨ Conclusion

My implementation extends the original project by adding a more advanced transaction system, improving code structure, reducing duplication, and enhancing user interaction.  
These improvements make the system closer to a real-world banking application and easier to extend in the future.
## 🧩 Project Enhancement

This project is an extended and improved version of [the original Bank Management System](https://github.com/MajdiAl-Hijazi/Project-Bank/tree/main/Bank(Certain_Feature)).  
I redesigned the transaction logic, improved code modularity, and added new features to make the system more robust and closer to real-world banking systems.
